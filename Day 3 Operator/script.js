
// In this code i use the 4 basic arthimetic operator 
let a = 5;
let b = 2;

console.log("a = " + a, "b = " + b); // they print the actual value of the operand 
console.log("a + b = ", a + b); // they add the value of a and b
console.log("a - b = ", a - b); // they sub the value of a and b
console.log("a * b = ", a * b); // they multiply the value of a and b
console.log("a / b = ", a / b); // they divide the value of a and b and not like c++ they show the decimal point

// now we have also use the exponential operator in js to calculate the value 
console.log("a ^ b = ", a ** b); // they a^b value is 25

// we have also the unary operator in js 
// increment and decrement and they have further two two types pre-increment and post-decrement
let c = 7;
console.log("a++ ", a++); // the post-increment print the value is the same and after that line increment
console.log("++c ", ++c); // the pre-increment increment the value first
// same is for decrement
