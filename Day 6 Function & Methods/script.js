// for-each loop in array
// for-each loop is actually a method which means it is the built in function and when ever we need then we invoked the function or call it.
// arrforEach(callbackFucntion)  callbackFucntion is function which is passed in the other function parameters.

  return val;
});

// we use the map function if we need the new array from the previous array and need to make the new one array so we do this by its own we can easily multiply it and print it in new array which we required. It is also the higher order funtion / method becuase we can easliy pass the other function in arguments and return it.




// filter object is like the for-each loop but it returns only the elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

// ðŸŽ¯ Final Takeaway
// Use .map() when transforming data (creating a new array).
// Use .forEach() when executing logic on each element without modifying the array.
// Use .filter() when extracting specific elements that match a condition.
// Would you like me to explain a real-world project using these concepts? ðŸš€ðŸ˜Š




// .reduce() is a powerful JavaScript array method that reduces an array to a single value. It is commonly used for calculations, aggregations, and data transformations.
